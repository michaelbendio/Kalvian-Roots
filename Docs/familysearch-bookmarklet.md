Kalvian Roots FamilySearch WebKit Extraction
===========================================

FamilySearch extraction is handled inside Kalvian Roots with a visible macOS
WebKit window. The app does not use a browser bookmarklet.

Behavior
--------

When the Juuret father has a FamilySearch ID, selecting the family in Kalvian
Roots opens the visible FamilySearch WebKit window to that father's Details
page and runs extraction after the page finishes loading.

When the Juuret father does not yet have a FamilySearch ID, selecting the
family opens FamilySearch in the visible WebKit window. The family view keeps an
"Extract in-app FamilySearch" button available so the user can locate the right
FamilySearch Details page manually and then extract from the current page.

Extraction Scope
----------------

The extractor reads only the currently visible FamilySearch person Details page
and its visible Spouses and Children groups. It opens each child's quick-card in
the page UI to read Birth, Christening, Death, and Burial values, then closes the
quick-card before moving to the next child.

FamilySearch quick-cards are interactive page UI, not a public API. The
extractor uses normal browser events: hover/click to open each card, pointer
leave/outside click/Escape to close it, and no DOM deletion. Extraction remains
manual or app UI-driven and is bounded to the current nuclear family.

Implementation
--------------

`FamilySearchDOMService.makeFamilySearchExtractorScript()` builds the shared DOM
extractor. WebKit wraps that script with
`FamilySearchDOMService.makeWebKitExtractionScript(...)` and returns the
structured JSON payload directly to Swift through the
`kalvianRootsFamilySearchExtraction` message handler.

Do not add automated crawling, hidden recursive traversal, or FamilySearch API
assumptions without a new approved design.
