/**
 * Complete family network supporting citation generation
 *
 * Citation Architecture:
 * - One shared nuclear family citation for parents and children
 * - Each married child gets nuclear citation + their death/marriage dates from asParent family
 * - Parents get citations from their asChild families (non-recursive)
 * - Spouses get citations from their asChild families (non-recursive)
 * - asChild families do NOT recursively follow their own parent/sibling references
