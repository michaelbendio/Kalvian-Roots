/**
 * FamilyResolver handles cross-reference resolution for genealogical families
 *
 * This class resolves:
 * - as_child references (where parents appear as children in their birth families)
 * - as_parent references (where children appear as parents in their own families)
 * - spouse families (where spouses appear in their birth families)
 *
 * The resolution process uses multiple strategies:
 * 1. Direct family ID lookup
 * 2. Birth date matching
 * 3. Name equivalence checking
 * 4. Marriage date validation
